## Sample Kotlin Application

Demonstrates the use of Manifold with Kotlin. In particular this application uses [manifold-graphql](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-graphql)
to show how resource files can be packaged in a separate Java module for use with Kotlin. Use this application as a
reference to set up Manifold with your own Kotlin applications.

See also [Using Manifold with Kotlin](http://manifold.systems/kotlin.html).

## Android Studio

Use Android Studio to edit, build, and execute this project.

Run the `com.example.server.MovieServer` class to start the sample GraphQL server.
Run the `com.example.client.MovieClient` class to execute a run GraphQL client against the server.

## Manifold plugin for Android Studio

Install the Manifold plugin directly from Android Studio from `Settings | Plugins | Marketplace` and search for
"Manifold".

You must restart Android Studio to use the plugin.
